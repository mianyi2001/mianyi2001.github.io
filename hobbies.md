## Sports

<br>In terms of sports, I prefer riding a bicycle and playing table tennis. I studied table tennis for one year during my undergraduate studies, and in my spare time, I often ride my own bicycle to explore the city. In June 2023, I cycled around Chaohu Lake for ten hours (about 150 kilometers)



## Vidio Games & Movies

<br>I enjoy watching movies, and I am a Marvel fan. The types of films I like include but are not limited to: science fiction, fantasy, suspense, detective, and drama. Additionally, I like playing video games, particularly those developed by miHoYo, such as Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail.
